# GroupSeq <img src="man/figures/logo.png" align="right" width="123" height="140"/>

Computes probabilities related to group sequential designs for normally
distributed test statistics. Enables to derive critical boundaries, power,
drift, and confidence intervals of such designs. Supports the alpha
spending approach by Lan-DeMets as well as the conditional rejection
probability principle by M"uller and Sch"afer.
