# GroupSeq <img src="man/figures/logo3D.png" alt="logo" align="right" width="200" height="250"/>

GroupSeq computes probabilities related to group sequential designs for normally
distributed test statistics. It enables to derive critical boundaries, power,
drift, and confidence intervals of such designs, mostly using the
alpha spending approach of @pmid7973215.

The main motivation for the development of this package was to make this area
of statistics freely available for a broad audience, which is one of the
reasons why all functionality is provided by a graphical user interface.


### Installation

```{r, eval = FALSE}
# Install release version from CRAN
install.packages("GroupSeq")

# Install development version from GitHub
devtools::install_github("rpahl/GroupSeq")
```


### Usage

Load the library to start the graphical user interface.
```{r, eval = FALSE}
library("GroupSeq")
```

```{r, out.width = "30%", echo = FALSE, fig.alt = "menu-after-load"}
include_graphics("man/figures/menu-after-load.png")
```

To get started see the
[General Introduction](https://rpahl.github.io/GroupSeq/articles/GroupSeq.html)
page.


### Alternative tools

Since the package was written back in 2005, the
graphical user interface may appear a bit outdated. Still, it does it's job and
at least has stood the test of time[$^1$](#refs).
Luckily in recent years others have started to
develop R-based tools with graphical user interface and similar (and more)
statistical functionality:

* [gsDesign](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=gsDesign) with a free
    [shiny web interface](https://gsdesign.shinyapps.io/prod/) including tutorials.
* [rpact](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=rpact) also with a free
    [shiny web interface](https://rpact.shinyapps.io/public) and lots of
    [vignettes](https://www.rpact.com/vignettes).

1. The package author is considering to
work on a second version with more functionality and a revised user interface
in the near future. Feel free to request new features
[here](https://github.com/rpahl/GroupSeq/issues).
